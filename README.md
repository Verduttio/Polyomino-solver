# Polyomino-solver

Polyomino solver checks whether from given polyomines can be composed first given polyomino.

To make an executable file use `ghc Polyomino_solver.hs`. Then to run the program use `Polyomino_solver.(extension) [inputFile]`.

inputFile should contain main polyomino (polyomino we want to compose), and set of polyominoes.  

inputFile structure:
```
main polyomino
1st polyomino
2nd polyomino
.
.
.
```

**Polyomino representation**  
We represent each polyomino by its coordinates in a virtual array.  
Example:  
Let's say we have a polyomino:  
```
###
  ##
   #
####
```
Let's add row and column numbers:
```
  0 1 2 3
0 # # #
1     # #
2       #
3 # # # #
```

Let's write down the coordinates now:  
`(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)`  
And these numbers are the representation of our polyomino and should be put into the inputFile.  
Coordinates structure: `(fst,snd)_(fst,snd)_...` where `_` is space.

In directiory `examples` in a file called example.txt you can find simple input example and in a file called exampleASCII.txt you can find polyominoes from example.txt in ASCII art style.
